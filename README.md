# 🌐 Onu Browser

**Onu** is a fast, minimalist browser designed to stay under **10 MB**—yet packed with enough features to make browsing expressive, playful, and powerful.  
Built entirely from scratch, Onu is not a fork of any existing browser. It’s a handcrafted engine with modular logic, cinematic branding, and plug-and-play customization.
