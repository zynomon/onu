**Onu** is a fast, Fallback browser for error.os it doesn't uses heavy storage the goal is to make the binary of onu small as possible and add bug fixes over features that aren't essential for someone who just can't find a fallback browser. ( not heavy redundant codebase).

i will update it tomorrow; but it will never happen  onu 0.3 is out now our plan is to add cross platform in onu 0.5 ( first stable release) 
onu 0.4 would be a remake from scratch instead of just improving the  current code base because a clean start could improve the application
